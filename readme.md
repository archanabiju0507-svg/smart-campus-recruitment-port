### Project Description
The Smart Campus Recruitment Portal is a centralized web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between students, college placement cells (TPO), and recruiting companies. It automates the end-to-end recruitment cycle from job posting and eligibility filtering to application tracking and final selection.
### The Problem statement
Traditional campus placement processes are often fragmented, relying on manual spreadsheets, paper resumes, and scattered email threads. This leads to data redundancy, lack of real-time updates for students, and an administrative burden on the placement office to verify eligibility for every job posting.

### The Solution
We provide a digital ecosystem where:
* Students can maintain a dynamic profile and apply to eligible jobs with one click.
* Companies can post vacancies and filter candidates based on CGPA, skills, or department.
* Admins (TPO) can oversee the entire process, verify student data, and generate placement reports instantly.
